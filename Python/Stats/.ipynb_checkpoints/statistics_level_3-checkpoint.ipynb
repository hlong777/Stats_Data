    "    * Pick the columns that we are going to work with \n",
    "    * Check the data types and fix them\n",

    "2. Join the two data sets\n",

    "    * Eliminate the `NaN` values\n",
    "    * Only use the apps which contain reviews\n",
    "3. Summarise the data visually and analytically (by the column `platform`)\n",
    "    * Use the function .describe()\n",
    "    * Use a boxplot\n",
    "4. Test the following hypothesis “The differences in the average ratings of apple and google users are due to chance and not due to differences in the platforms” \n",
